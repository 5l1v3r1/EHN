Various open source methodologies have been created to address the security
assessment's needs. Using these assessment methodologies, one can strategically
accomplish the time-critical and challenging task of assessing the system's security
regardless of its size and complexity. Some methodologies focus on the technical
aspect of security testing, while others focus on managerial criteria, and very few
address both sides. The basic idea behind formalizing these methodologies with your
assessment is to execute different types of tests step-by-step in order to accurately
judge the security posture of a system.

Therefore, you will be introduced to several well-known security assessment
methodologies that provide you with an extended view of the assessing network
and application security by highlighting their key features and benefits. These
include the following:

- Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual
- Information Systems Security Assessment Framework
- Open Web Application Security Project Testing Guide
- Web Application Security Consortium Threat Classification
- Penetration Testing Execution Standard

All of these testing frameworks and methodologies will assist security professionals
choose the best strategy that adheres to their client's requirements. The first two
provide you with general guidelines and methods of security testing for almost
any type of information asset. The testing frameworks provided by Open Web
Application Security Project (OWASP) and Web Application Security Consortium
(WASC) primarily deal with the assessment of application security. Penetration
Testing Execution Standard (PTES) will provide you with guidance on all types of
penetration testing efforts. It is, however, important to note that security is an ongoing
process in itself and a penetration test is a snapshot that details the security
posture at the time of the test. Any minor change in the target environment may
affect the entire process of security testing and could introduce errors in the final
results. Additionally, adapting any single methodology does not necessarily provide
you with a complete picture of the risk assessment process. It is left to the security
auditor to select the best strategy that could address the target testing criteria.
There are many security testing methodologies; choosing the best one requires a
careful selection process through which one can determine the cost and effectiveness
of the assessment. Thus, determining the right assessment strategy depends on
several factors, including the technical details provided about the target environment
and resource availability, pentester's knowledge, business objectives, and regulatory
concerns. From a business standpoint, efficiency and cost control is of extreme
importance. Each of the following testing methodologies have very detailed and
well-written documentation at their respective sites. We provide a brief summary
of each, but to truly understand how they work in detail, you need to go to their
respective websites and carefully study the documentation and implementation
details provided by their creators
