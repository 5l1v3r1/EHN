##Penetration Testing

Penetration testing is considered to be the last and most aggressive form of security
assessment. It must be handled by qualified professionals and can be conducted with
or without prior knowledge of the targeted network or application. A pentest may
be used to assess all IT infrastructure components including applications, network
devices, operating systems, communication medium, physical security, and human
psychology. The output of penetration testing usually consists of a report divided
into several sections that address the weaknesses found in the current state of the
target environment, followed by potential countermeasures and other remediation
recommendations. The use of a methodological process provides extensive benefits
to the pentester to understand and critically analyze the integrity of current defenses
during each stage of the testing process.

###Types of penetration testing

Although there are different types of penetration testing, the two most general
approaches that are widely accepted by the industry are the black box and white box.
These approaches will be discussed in the following sections.

####Black box testing

While applying this approach, the security auditor will be assessing the network
infrastructure and will not be aware of any internal technologies deployed by the
targeted organization. By employing a number of real-world hacker techniques and
going through organized test phases, vulnerabilities may be revealed and potentially
exploited. It is important for a pentester to understand, classify, and prioritize these
vulnerabilities according to their level of risk (low, medium, or high). The risk can be
measured according to the threat imposed by the vulnerability in general. An ideal
penetration tester would determine all attack vectors that could cause the target to
be compromised. Once the testing process has been completed, a report that contains
all the necessary information regarding the targets' real-world security posture,
categorizing, and translating the identified risks into a business context, is generated.
Black box testing can be a more expensive service than white box testing.

####White box testing

An auditor involved in this kind of penetration testing process should be aware of all
the internal and underlying technologies used by the target environment. Hence, it
opens a wide gate for a penetration tester to view and critically evaluate the security
vulnerabilities with minimum possible efforts and utmost accuracy. It does bring
more value to the organization in comparison to the black box approach in the sense
that it will eliminate any internal security issues lying at the target infrastructure's
environment, thus making it more difficult for a malicious adversary to infiltrate
from the outside. The number of steps involved in white box testing is similar to
that of black box testing. Moreover, the white box approach can easily be integrated
into a regular development life cycle to eradicate any possible security issues at
an early stage before they get disclosed and exploited by intruders. The time, cost,
and knowledge level required to find and resolve the security vulnerabilities is
comparably less than with the black box approach.

###Vulnerability assessment versus penetration testing

There is always a need to understand and practice the correct terminology for
security assessment. Throughout your career, you may run into commercial grade
companies and non-commercial organizations that are likely to misinterpret the term
penetration testing when trying to select an assessment type. It is important that you
understand the differences between these types of tests.
Vulnerability assessment is a process to assess the internal and external security
controls by identifying the threats that pose serious exposure to the organizations'
assets. This technical infrastructure evaluation not only points to the risks in the
existing defenses, but also recommends and prioritizes the remediation strategies.
The internal vulnerability assessment provides you with an assurance to secure
the internal systems, while the external vulnerability assessment demonstrates the
security of the perimeter defenses. In both testing criteria, each asset on the network
is rigorously tested against multiple attack vectors to identify unattended threats
and quantify the reactive measures. Depending on the type of assessment being
carried out, a unique set of testing processes, tools, and techniques are followed to
detect and identify vulnerabilities in the information assets in an automated fashion.
This can be achieved using an integrated vulnerability management platform that
manages an up-to-date vulnerabilities database and is capable of testing different
types of network devices while maintaining the integrity of configuration and
change management.

A key difference between the vulnerability assessment and penetration testing is
that the penetration testing goes beyond the level of identifying vulnerabilities and
hooks into the process of exploitation, privilege escalation, and maintaining access
to the target system(s). On the other hand, vulnerability assessment provides you
with a broad view of any existing flaws in the system without measuring the impact
of these flaws to the system under consideration. Another major difference between
both of these terms is that the penetration testing is considerably more intrusive than
the vulnerability assessment and aggressively applies all of the technical methods
to exploit the live production environment. However, the vulnerability assessment
process carefully identifies and quantifies all the known vulnerabilities in a
non-invasive manner.
